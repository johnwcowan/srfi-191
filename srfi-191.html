<h1><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h1>

<p>Many Scheme systems provide mechanisms for inspecting the arity of a
procedural value, making it a common feature, however there is no
standard interface.  As a result there is no portable way to observe
the arity of a procedure without actually applying it.  This
SRFI proposes a simple interface that is consistent with existing
Scheme systems' facilities and prior proposals.</p>

<h1><a name="Rationale">Rationale</a></h1>

<p>This proposal provides a single procedure that makes it
possible to determine if a procedure 
applied to a particular number of arguments either may accept them
or definitely does not accept them.
This is the first step towards being able to determine safely
whether a procedure can safely call another procedure passed to it
as an argument.
Equivalent functionality is already supported in several Scheme implementations
and it should be easy to add support in many more systems.
This particular interface is based on an
<a href="https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-102/msg/2771967/">
email by Kent Dybvig sent to the SRFI-102 mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Many Scheme systems provide procedure inspection facilities for
properties other than arity, such as source code, source location, and documentation.
This SRFI focuses solely on the ability to retrieve arity information from
procedural values; features for retrieving other kinds of information
from procedures are considered beyond the scope of this proposal and
left for future SRFIs to take up.</p>

<p>For the history of earlier proposals,
see the <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-102/srfi-102.html#Rationale">
Rationale of SRFI 102</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="Specification">Specification</a></h1>

<p class="proto">
<code>(procedure-arity-mask <em>proc</em>) &rarr; <em>exact integer</em></code>
</p>

<p>Returns an exact integer <em>n</em> such that if the implementation
can prove that <em>proc</em> definitely cannot be called with
<em>k</em> arguments, then the <em>k</em>th bit of <em>n</em> is 0.
Otherwise, the <em>k</em>th bit is 1.  The 0th bit of <em>k</em>
is the least significant bit; positive integers are left extended with
zeros and negative integers with ones.</p>

<p>The implications of this are that
if a procedure can only be called with <em>k</em> arguments,
then <em>n</em> = 2<sup><em>k</em></sup>.
If a procedure can be called with <em>k</em> or more arguments,
then <em>n</em> = -2<sup><em>k</em></sup> - 1.  In particular,
if the procedure can be called with any number of arguments,
then <em>n</em> = -1.  If <em>n</em> = 0,
the procedure cannot be called at all, which should never happen.</p>

<p>Most Schemes expand away <code>case-lambda</code> before
compilation, and so such procedures will return -1.
However, some implementations might preserve information from
<code>case-lambda</code>.  If so,
a procedure that accepts exactly 1, 3, or 5 arguments would return
<em>n</em> = 2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> = 42,
whereas a procedure that accepts 0, 2, 4, or 6 or more arguments
(which is to say, a procedure that rejects 1, 3, or 5 arguments)
would return <em>n</em> = <code>(bitwise-not 42)</code> = -43.

<h1>
<a name="Implementation">Implementation</a>
</h1>

<p>A simple and portable sample implementation is:

<pre>(define (procedure-arity-mask n) -1)</pre>

<p>Since a <em>k</em>th bit of 1 means that the procedure <em>may</em> be callable
with <em>k</em> arguments, this is completely correct (and useless).</p>

<p>Racket provides a native implementation.</p>

<p>An implementation on top of SRFI 102's API can be found
in the repository of this SRFI.  It depends on the <code>bitwise-ior</code>
procedure, which can be found in R6RS and in various SRFIs including
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-151/srfi-151.html">SRFI 151</a>,
"Integers as Bits".</p>

I would like to thank Eli Barzilay, R. Kent Dybvig, Matthias
Felleisen, Daniel P. Friedman, and Shriram Krishnamurthi for answering
questions on the history of arity inspection in Scheme.  In
particular, I would like to further thank R. Kent Dybvig for providing
the analysis of why <em>not</em> to support arity inspection.  I would
like to thank Aaron W. Hsu for providing information on Chez Scheme's
procedure inspection facilities.  I am grateful to Michael Sperber for
